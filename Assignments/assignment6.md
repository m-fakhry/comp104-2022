# Assignment 6

1. Read sections 4.4

2. Trace the following code fragment, showing the value of each variable each time it changes:

        float x = 4.15;
        for (int i=0; i < 3; i++)
          x *= 2;

3. Write a C++ program that accepts a single integer value entered by the user. If the value entered is less than one, the program prints nothing. If the user enters a positive integer, n, the program prints an n×n box drawn with * characters.


4. An approximate value of $\pi$ can be calculated using the series given below: $\pi = 4 ( 1- 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 + ... + (-1)^n / (2n+1))$. Write a program to calculate the approximate value of 𝝅 using this series. The program takes an input n that determines the number of terms in the approximation of the value of $pi$ and outputs the approximation. Include a loop that allows the user to repeat this calculation for new values n until the user says she or he wants to end the program.
